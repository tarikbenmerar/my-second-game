## My Second Ever Game Sokoban from 2005

This repo is my second ever game called Sokoban coded around Fall 2005, after coding on Summer my first game (actually a snake game) using Flash. Unfortunately, I don't have anymore access to that source code letting alone the only first available videogame code is this one. The game has also a level constructor.

## The Story behind the game

I started getting interest in programming 1998-1999 (11-12 years old), after discovering by chance a Basic interpreter (QBasic) inside Windows (Actually, my father mentionned to me Basic as one of the programming languages he used). I had some books at home on basic, and tried to do some interesting things. 

A year later, I have done some Visual Basic coding, where I have done my first failed experiments on collision detection between two Visual Basic visual objects (buttons), as my ultimate dream was to code a video game (Later on, I discovered that I tried to implement AABB algorithm but had  some bugs and didn't know why it didn't work). I have also experimented coding how a game persona jumps (without the needed physics knowledge, so the algorithm was too simplistic).  

Unfortunately, I couldn't do a game at that time except some failed experiments and some copy pasting some codes (a strange program that uses sines and cosine to generate waves drawing, pretty strange shape).

Through the following six-seven years, I cameback to programming from time to time, crashing the PC sometimes, experimenting other languages such as Pascal. Neverthless, I missed the most important concept, called algorithms. I always thought that the if/for/while and those basics stuff were nothing and I missed the most important and complicated things. 

Thanks to Internet, I read a whole course on Algorithm back in summer 2005 (right after getting my baccalaur√©at) that opened my eyes. The course taught me that I had all the basics needed while explaining me more elaborate concepts such as functions and procedures and why they are used (decomposing a program). This game summarizes my first real programming knowledges (No OOP yet).

Ultimately, I began coding the first game in Flash (Snake), and the second one mentionned in this repo.

## How to run it ?

Honestly, I don't remember. I found a basic interpreter that give me access to some Sprite APIs that I could exploit to generate the videogame graphics.

## What you became right now ?

I hold a PhD in Computing (Cloud Computing and dMRI). I am a lecturer at the USTHB university, Algeria. I am also a web development consultant at Toptal and have an entrepreneurship project throught Acigna Inc.. I basically accomplished my dream but the initial magic and excitement has faded away through years. I always miss those initial years.
